**_Re-Shade Effects_**

These are simple shading post-processing effects made using ReShade - a generic post-processing injector.
These shader effects were made for personal learning but feel free to use these shaders as you like

Down below attatched are a few examples of the shading effects I have made
This includes Dithering, Chromatic Abberation & more
